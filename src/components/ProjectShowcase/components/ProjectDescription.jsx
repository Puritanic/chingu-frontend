          Chingu is building a global collaboration platform and coding-cohort
          generator. A Chingu-cohort is a build-to-learn community, where
          motivated developers from around the world, are organized into teams
          to build a project in 8 weeks. We call these cohorts, Voyages. Chingu
          so far has been a collaboration platform without an actual “platform”.
          For each of the 50+ cohorts we’ve ran - which includes people from 135
          different countries - we’ve managed to stay afloat using several
          unconnected tools such as forms, spreadsheets, slack, github repos,
          and trellos. With this many people, things tend to get a little messy
          and chaotic -- for all of us. Our project for this competition aims to
          fix this and to allow our thriving underground community to emerge.

        <h3>What we learned</h3>
        <p>
          That people are supercharged when optimally placed in an engaged
          community with shared goals. And that this is especially true for
          learners.
